1. User groups
	-> I have craeted a new category in user's access right page called "User Role"
	-> There are 4 groups. [Procurement, COO, MD, Vendor]
	-> User have to be in one of these groups.
	-> I have implemented user functionalities as required based on different groups.

2. Signature
	-> There are a new page in user's form view called signature.
	-> First provide signature for a user.
	-> Then it can be found in PDF report.

3. Report
	-> Report can be found in purchase_order form page inside "Print" button named as "Purchase Order 		Pdf".
	-> I could not understand all the fields in the provided report. But I tried my best.
